    Everything Japanese is a mod that was created on the 9th of September, at least that was when the mod's first version was published. But creation actually started way before then.

<h2>
    The file everything-japanese-0.0.1-1.21.1.jar was actually and Invalid file. It was compressed using WinRAR instead of the inbuilt Task to turn the mod into a Jar file
